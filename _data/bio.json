        "summary": "I am a creative and energetic global thinker and a leader in implementing community project objectives by working really hard in challenging and sometimes hostile situations. In many of the places I have worked in emotions run high as the communities I am working with have a legacy of being disenfranchised through culturally and economically. I think that most citizens of the US feel that there is so much at stake in the way our current culture politics are running the world and not engaging people in true conversation that illicit change of behavior and this causes anxiety on so many levels. All communities seek agency over their resources, lands and culture, it is my most humble and proud work in collaboration with people in Hawaii and around the globe to help to achieve this goal. My skill set is incredibly diverse, being a successful social entrepreneur to sustainable building designer and working artistically with the community. I have a brain and soul that want to be engaged and learn new things, fight for social and environmental justice and create beauty that begins a conversation on vital issues to our culture and democracy. I am a passionate politically active woman who really does in the power of a democracy and that our legacy in continually improving upon it is paying it forward to future generations.",
